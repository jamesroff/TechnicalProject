Created new brach for simulations of alternative non-dimensionalisation of initial model.

Branches - AltNonDimSimulations
Code implementing simulations of the alternative non-dimensionalisation for the initial model.

Files:
Derivative.m - Simple function modelling the set of ODEs (no QWM) for use in ode45
CalculateParameters.m - Simple function which calculates the required dimensionless parameters, with varying q and L.
QuarterWaveSimulation.m - Function which completes a simulation of the QWM using the parameters inputted
ImpactGeometricSeries.m - Script to calculate and plot different implementations of treating impact times as a geometric series
