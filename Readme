Identified issue with QWM equations, with one term contributing to an overdamped system.

Branches - QuarterWaveModel
Code implementing simulation and phase portraits for Quarter Wave model.

Files:
CubicFactorisation.m - simple code to symbolically solve algebraic inequality
Derivative.m - Simple function modelling the set of ODEs (no QWM) for use in ode45
FullDerivative.m - Simple function modelling the set of ODEs for the QWM, suitable for use in ode45
QuarterWaveSimulation.m - Function which completes a simulation of the QWM using the parameters inputted

ImpactGeometricSeries.m - Script to calculate and plot different implementations of treating impact times as a geometric series
